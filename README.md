**This project is at a stopping point. Pull requests still taken.**

## Not Official
This repo started as a side project to get some co-workers up to speed on Umbraco as told through another developers point of view limited to the scope of version 7.  The official documentation is located here: https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco4Docs and should be used as the source of truth.  The official documentation covers other versions of Umbraco as well as version 7.

*Learn Umbraco 7* is a crowd authored book with the purpose of onboarding new Umbraco developers for free.  This book isn't intended to be a resource guide, please refer to the official Umbraco documentation for that.  This book is a narrative of different topics in the Umbraco 7 realm.

This book is downloadable despite not being complete. It's completeness is hovering around 90% and is updated as new features of Umbraco 7 are released.  Please consider writing a section :)  You can find the TODO list here: https://github.com/kgiszewski/LearnUmbraco7/issues

## Style Guide

#### Structure
The structure of this books is the following:

* `Chapter` - Chapters are folders named as `{Chapter Number} - {Chapter Name}` 
    * `Section` - A section is a markdown file named as `{Section Number} - {Section Name}.md`
    * `Assets` - A folder for media (to hold images/pdfs for this chapter) named as `assets`
    * `Readme.md` - All folders are required to have one and this serves as an overview page

#### Do Use Markdown
Everything should be written in markdown and not HTML.  If you are not familiar with markdown, please use these references:

* https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/
* https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/

#### Do Use Root Relative, Current Relative or External Links
Use links that are rooted from the top level like so `[click me](/LearnUmbraco7/01 - Chapter 0/readme.md)`.

#### Do Not Use Relative Paths with Double Dots
These type of links `[click me](../01 - Chapter 0/readme.md)` are useful normally, but create a security issue when downloaded into things like [Umbraco Bookshelf](https://github.com/kgiszewski/UmbracoBookshelf).
>Side note, Umbraco Bookshelf ignores these types of links.

#### Do Split Things Up
Try to split chapters into logical sections.

#### Do Use the Assets Folder
Each chapter has an `assets` folder where your pdf and image files should go.

When linking assets, use relative paths like `![my image](assets/myimage.png)`.

#### Do Use Blockquotes for Callouts
Need to call something out?  Use a blockquote.

#### Do Use Code Literals and Namespaces
Use code blocks when showing code.  Always include namespaces for C#.

## So what should you contribute?
Each chapter and section has TODO lists associated with them as well as general outlines of future content. Feel free to tackle any of those or submit other TODOs.  Here are some other examples of what you can contribute:

* Sample Code
* Diagrams
* Photos from the Umbraco World
* Editing by reading, correcting and clarifying; if it's wrong say so :)

Each person that has been assimilated into Umbraco has a unique opportunity to contribute in some way.  We have a TODO list here: https://github.com/kgiszewski/LearnUmbraco7/issues

## A Note to Grammar Nazis
Writing narrative text is not our best skill so if you see an issue with overall organization, grammar, spelling and/or other issues; we expect a pull-request to fix the issues :)
